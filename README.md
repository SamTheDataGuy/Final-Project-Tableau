# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on FIFA 2018 video game player data
- Attempt to discover interesting correlations from the data using visualizations
- Analyze player wages vs player overall score to see how players are overvalued/undervalued

## Process
### Step 1: download, clean, and upload dataset to Tableau
- Downloaded FIFA 2018 player data csv and converted to an excel file
- Created new column to show each players' first preferred position
- Removed stats based on position (columns CAM	CB	CDM	CF	CM	LAM	LB	LCB	LCM	LDM	LF	LM	LS	LW	LWB	RAM	RB	RCB	RCM	RDM	RF	RM	RS	RW	RWB	ST)
- Added cleaned excel file as a data source in Tableau

### Step 2: Create EDA visualizations
- Histograms for age, overall, wage
- Overall vs Average Wage
- Overall vs Ball Control
- Player Count by Nationality
- Average Wage by Nationality

### Step 3: Add visualizations to a dashboard
